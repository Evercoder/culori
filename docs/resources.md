## Extras

These projects add more functionality to culori, but they're separate as to keep the core bundle small:

-   **[culori-scales](https://github.com/evercoder/culori-scales)** — color scales (ColorBrewer, matplotlib, etc).
-   **[culori-names](https://github.com/evercoder/culori-names)** — More named colors, from a variety of sources.

## Products using culori

-   **[Moqups](https://moqups.com)** — all our color-manipulation functions are handled by culori.
-   **[Dainty](https://dainty-vs.now.sh)** — Dainty is a configurable refined and balanced color theme for Visual Studio using Culori’s CIELAB capabilities for generating and processing colors.
