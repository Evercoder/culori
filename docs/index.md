Culori is a color library for JavaScript that supports most color spaces and formats defined in the [CSS Colors Level 4][css4-colors] spec ([named colors][css4-named-colors], [Hex colors](hex-colors) (3 to 8 digits), [RGB](rgb-colors), [HSL](hsl-colors), [HWB](hwb-colors), [Lab and LCh](lab-colors)), plus [additional color spaces](./color-spaces).

It handles [color differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference), interpolation, gradients, blend modes [and more](./api).

## Another JS color library?

Mike Bostock's [d3-color](https://github.com/d3/d3-color), and Gregor Aisch's [chroma.js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js) are two excellent, robust libraries that provide most of what you need for working with colors on the web. The [Resources](./resources) section for even more libraries you can try.

Culori does a few things differently:

-   The API is function-oriented rather than [fluent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface). Colors are represented as plain JavaScript objects you pass through a series of [functions](./api).
-   On the `alpha` channel, the library doesn't equate an `undefined` value with an opaque color, but rather with a color for which we don't care about the opacity. This gives you the opportunity to interpret `undefined` as you see fit. The hex string <kbd>#ff0000</kbd> _should_ probably be rendered as fully opaque red, but for running functions on colors it's useful to discern <kbd>#ff0000</kbd> from <kbd>#ff0000ff</kbd> â€” the former has an implicit alpha of 1, while for the latter it's explicit.
