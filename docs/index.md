Culori is a JavaScript color library that supports the conversion and manipulation of all formats defined in the [CSS Colors Level 4][css4-colors] specification, plus [additional color spaces](./color-spaces). It handles [color differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference), interpolation, gradients, blend modes [and much more](/api/).

```bash
npm install culori
```

## What sets Culori apart?

__A function-oriented API.__ Colors are represented as plain JavaScript objects you pass through a series of [functions](./api), which makes it super easy to extend.

__Accurate alpha.__ On the `alpha` channel, the library doesn't equate an `undefined` value with an opaque color, but rather with a color for which we don't care about the opacity. This gives you the opportunity to interpret `undefined` as you see fit. The hex string <kbd>#ff0000</kbd> _should_ probably be rendered as fully opaque red, but for running functions on colors it's useful to discern <kbd>#ff0000</kbd> from <kbd>#ff0000ff</kbd> â€” the former has an implicit alpha of 1, while for the latter it's explicit.

__Comprehensive functionality.__ Build advanced color tools with Culori's rich collection of color spaces and functions.

__Tree-shakeable version available.__ When you're ready to optimize for bundle size, switch to [a tree-shakeable version of the library](./guides/tree-shaking).
