Culori is the Romanian word for ‘colors’. The logo is typeset in [Hatch](https://pstypelab.com/hatchfont) by Mark Caneso.

Culori is indebted to Mike Bostock's [D3.js](https://github.com/d3) and Gregor Aisch's [chroma.js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js). D3, in particular, has been a treasure-trove of ideas and academic references.

The code is formatted with [prettier](https://prettier.io) and bundled with [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup), [buble](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/buble), and [terser](https://github.com/terser-js/terser). Tests use [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape). The library does not have external run-time dependencies.
