Culori is developed by [Dan Burzo](http://danburzo.ro) with the help of many collaborators, and released under the MIT license. 

The library has been inspired by Mike Bostock's [D3.js](https://github.com/d3) and Gregor Aisch's [chroma.js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js): they have popularized color science in the browser and provided a blueprint for a color manipulation API. I have learned a tremendous amount by reading through the documentation the source code while developing Culori. D3, in particular, has been a treasure trove of ideas and pointers to academic references.
 
I pronounce the name of the library as [[kuːlori]](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=ku%CB%90lori). Culori is the Romanian word for ‘colors’. The logo is typeset in [Hatch](https://pstypelab.com/hatchfont) by Mark Caneso.

The code is formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io), upkept with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), tested with [tape](https://github.com/ljharb/tape), and bundled with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). This website is statically generated using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and published to GitHub Pages.
