# Culori

Culori is a general-purpose color library for JavaScript. It incorporates, and extends, ideas from Mike Bostock's [D3.js](https://github.com/d3) and Gregor Aisch's [chroma.js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js).

_(âš  Until version _1.0.0_ the API will be changing quite a bit, until I find an adequate expression)_

### Color Spaces

Culori supports all the formats defined in the [CSS Colors Level 4][css4-colors]: [Named colors][css4-named-colors], [Hex colors](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#hex-notation) (3 to 8 digits), [RGB](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#rgb-functions), [HSL](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#the-hsl-notation), [HWB](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#the-hwb-notation), [Lab and LCh](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#lab-colors), and [Grays](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#grays). Additionally, the [Linear RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB#The_sRGB_transfer_function_(%22gamma%22)), [HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) (also known as HSB), [HSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV), and [Cubehelix](https://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/%7Edag/CUBEHELIX/) color spaces are supported.

### Color Differences

To compute [color differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference), Culori implements both the simple Euclidean distance and the CIELAB Delta E* metric as formulated by CIE76, CIE94, CIEDE2000 and CMC l:c (1984).
