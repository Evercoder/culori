## Culori Changelog

### 0.5.2

-   Adds YIQ color space and Kotsarenko/Ramos color difference function (thanks [@mourner](https://github.com/mourner) for the pointer!)
-   Adds the _weights_ argument to _differenceEuclidean_

### 0.5.1

**Breaking:** Removed the `culori()` function, which was an alias for `culori.rgb()`. This makes the build simpler and clarifies the API a bit.

Cleaned up the build process; added Prettier, ESLint.
